Yes, there were reasons why I did this. 

First, I like challenges. 

Second, I made a (very unsuccesful) game on Replit. It was never published. 

Third, I wanted to learn basic (but hard, being the only game developer) game development. 

Fourth, I suck at art. So I practice on here. 

Fifth, I had almost nothing on my Github before the project.

And that is all for now. (Written after 0.16 and during 0.17)
